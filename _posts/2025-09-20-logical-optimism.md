description: "Being slightly less delusional"

I always think that the impossible is possible if I think about it again. For instance, I’m very optimistic that I can pass my finals without studying prior to them. What makes me optimistic is that the fact that I know the fundamentals is enough to satisfy my beliefs. I always wonder why I would learn things If the things are already can be easily related to one another.

I always think optimism is a delusional thing. But everyone that I observe always does it like that[^1].

## Personal Factors
Interests plays in role on the way I shaped my beliefs. Because It's the very fundamental, simply the base of my optimistic journey. Think of it like a starting point to being optimistic. But the problem is that people have different interests.

Sometimes I really want to know how it actually works fundamentally then go to a slightly higher level. Because knowing just the higher level abstracts the fundamentals. For example, I like learning the conventions. It teaches me how to do things that has been agreed upon.

## How logical?
You can't be optimistic and logical at the same time. Even when I sound logical and optimistic, I still sounds like I'm delusional. But thats because It's all about knowing the balance between being optimistic and logical—[^2]neither wins. Knowing the fundementals allows me to improvise and relate to different and yet relatable ideas. Below is a great example of how I think, and probably you, and everyone.

Thats just on how I relate to good ideas to different good ideas, even the bad ideas can be related. For example, If I think of “computers”, my mind relates to “IBM PC/XT”, “Commodore 64”, “POSIX”, and "8086". I can assure you that you can't relate to those ideas. Because everyone relate their ideas differently. But once again, I feel like everyone I've met can't really relate their ideas. It's like they're locked into one idea(s) that are far apart or not even exist yet to one another. So its hard for them to improvised and innovate. Well everyone that I observe are good at relating social cues, whilst not keen at relating common conventional(s).

## Conclusion
I should make a book out of this.
