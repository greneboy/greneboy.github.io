Hello there, hopefully it's not that difficult to keep my blogs alive, because I need to think more and more, and a little more to write this blog to say what I'm thinking. The thing that I think is based on what I see, and when I see something that I don't like, I complain and rant. But when I feel like a good person, I will start to make helpful blogs. But sometimes you can get mixed ones.

This blog is going to be simpleâ€”I won't be adding fancy things. If you can read this, it means that it's already perfect.

## Here's my plan

1. I think of something that interest me
2. I think more to that
3. Do some research, but still biased because this is my blog
4. Write the blog
5. Write the blog part #2
6. Publish
7. Repeat
